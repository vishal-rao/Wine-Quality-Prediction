# Wine-Quality-Prediction
This is a beginner project to understand the working of the machine learning libraries 
The data is first visualised in terms of histograms and box plots , a heat map is plotted to understand the corelation between the features, features with corelation above 0.6 are removed.
The data is scaled to ensure smooth working of the algorithms the data was reduced using PCA and a logistic regression was run on the reduced data this has helped me achieve a prediction accuracy of 93.75%
